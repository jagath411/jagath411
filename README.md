Hello, I'm Jagath, a DevOps Engineer with a passion for cloud computing. I enjoy designing, building, and deploying cloud-based solutions that are scalable, reliable, and secure.

With experience working on public cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform, I am well-versed in various cloud services and their capabilities. My skills also include containerization technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes, as well as infrastructure-as-code tools like Terraform and Ansible.

In my free time, I enjoy experimenting with new cloud technologies and contributing to open-source projects. I also enjoy sharing my knowledge and experiences with the community through blog posts and talks.

If you have any questions or would like to discuss a potential collaboration, please feel free to reach out to me via email or LinkedIn. I'm always happy to chat and learn from fellow enthusiasts.
